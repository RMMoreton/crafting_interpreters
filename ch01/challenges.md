# Chapter 1 Challenges

1.  What domain-specific languages were used in creating the book?
    1.  `HTML`
    1.  `CSS`
    1.  `SASS`
    1.  `Makefile`
    1.  `XML` - not included in the answer key, but there is some XML in the
        repo I swear! It might all be machine-generated though.
    1.  `YAML` - not included in the answer key, but there is a single file
        of it.
    1.  `Markdown` - I didn't get this, but it's obvious and I thought I had
        listed it. Whoops.
    1.  `Jinja2` - I didn't get this, I didn't see any of it. Whoops.

1.  1.  Write "Hello World" in Java.
        -   See `./java/hello_world.java` for the code.
    1.  Get a debugger working.
        -   I'm using VSCode, so for now debugging is as easy as setting a
            breakpoint by clicking on the line I want to break on, and then
            clicking "debug" above `main()`. Maybe it'll get tougher as the
            project gets more complicated.

1.  1.  Write "Hello World" in C.
        -   See `./c/hello_world.c` for the code.
    1.  Get a debugger working.
        -   VSCode makes it easy, again. It auto-filled a launch config that
            worked without any issues. Hopefully that continues!
    1.  Write a linked-list in C.
        -   See `./c/linked_list.c` for the code.
    1.  Test your linked-list.
